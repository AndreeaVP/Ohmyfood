# Integrate a Mobile Website with Animations in CSS

## Overview

Ohmyfood is a new startup restaurant business. The goal was to develop a 100% mobile-friendly website listing restaurant menus.
The entire site has been built to be mobile, tablet and desktop responsive. Fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari.

## Mandatory Guidelines

* The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript.
* No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus.
* No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
* The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.
